## This is my first landing page as a developer.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers. It will get updated from time to time.


## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`
